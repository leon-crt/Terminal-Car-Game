# Terminal-Car-Game
This is a small retro "shoot em up" style game I coded for a university project, I did not make use of graphic libraries and all of the "sprites" are just ASCII characters. 
The project had restrictions on the rules of the game: there must be a score system with levels, every 100 points the level must be incremented, as levels progress the game has to be harder and if you get hit you lose points, if your score reaches 0 you lose. 
I personally think the last one is a pretty bad design choice since it takes 1 hit to lose at first (which isn't going to happen because the difficulty is too low) but after a while you can never lose. I'd have implemented a lives system so that the stakes don't lower as you progress.
